Please run "final_report_2021..." in an r-session!
The report uses shiny applications making it not possible to generate a standalone HTML-File because the HTML output is dependent on a running R-session in the background.
Publishing the app on shinyapps.io was not possible, because one of the required packages "FitFileR" can not be installed on shinyapps.io.

Using the Rproj:
By including other / more activities in the .fit format in the project folder, other tracks or other athletes can be analysed. The area of investigation is limited to Switherland (because of the underlying digital elevation model). Adding other / new tracks to the project directory, the output of the interactive report will change.
Data of two different athletes (_a01 and a_02) can be imported. By selecting a specific athlete in the r-code the results of the report changes.
