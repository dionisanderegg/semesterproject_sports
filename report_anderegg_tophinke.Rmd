## Abstract 

In this semester project, sports tracks are analysed using GPS data from a Garmin device to identify specific behaviour patterns in outdoor sports (jogging, hiking, biking). Furthermore, the time required for sporting activities is modelled based on the individual fitness level, so that a user-specific forecast of the time required for sporting activities is possible. Model inputs are distance, altitude differences and the type of sport.

## 1 Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Sport watches are a popular tool for monitor and regulate training activities among both professional and amateur athletes. Studies have already investigated for different sports watches (Apple, Coros, Garmin, Polar, and Suunto) how much the GPS data corresponds to reality authorsN / editorsN, +initials, +<joinchar>[@gilgen-ammannAccuracyDistanceRecordings2020] .

## 2 Methods <a name="methods"></a>


### 2.1 Preparation of data <a name="subparagraph1"></a>
A dataset (data.frame) was generated using sports tracks data from a garmin-sportwatch by Dionis Anderegg. The data which can be obtained via the Garmin portal include spatio-temporal information (GPS-points, time,) and  heart-rates, which comes within the .fit format. The tracks are already divided into the corresponding type of sport "jogging", "hiking", "biking".

### 2.2 Evaluation of data <a name="subparagraph1"></a>
To evaluate the data, a suitable digital elevation model DEM (e.g. DHM25) is  used in order to compare  the information of the .fit files.
