## Abstract 

In this semester project, sports tracks are analysed using GPS data from a Garmin device to identify specific behaviour patterns in outdoor sports (jogging, hiking, biking). Furthermore, the time required for sporting activities is modelled based on the individual fitness level, so that a user-specific forecast of the time required for sporting activities is possible. Model inputs are distance, altitude differences and the type of sport.
